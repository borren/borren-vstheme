# borren-vstheme

**What?**

- Visual studio code (vscode) theme with smooth soft colorscheme leaning to the darker side

## Why?

I really needed som softer colors when working in my terminal, so as i stumbled on a neovim video on youtube by Linkarzu, i saw he had a colortheme that really seemed to suit me as well! I blatantly ripped [linkarzu-vscolors](https://github.com/linkarzu/linkarzu-vscolors/tree/master) from him. Altho i will be changing some of the coloring, the main palette is used from Linkarzys settings.

## How?

- To use this theme, you can install it from here: [borren-vstheme](https://github.com/borren/borren-vstheme)
- For reference! Go check `Linkarzu's` setting up his vscode for markdown/vim usage
